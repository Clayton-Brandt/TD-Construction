# TD-Construction
The best website you'll ever visit.

To run the website, install XAMP and go to C:\xampp\htdocs and create the folder tdconstruction. Put all the website files in there.
To run the database, go to admin for MySQL and press import and name the database td_construction. That should work.

Once that's set up open XAMP and start Apache and MySQL. Press admin for Apache, then tdconstruction to view the website.
Press admin for MySQL to view the database. The website should run locally and if it's set up properly on your computer it should run fine. Maybe.

Also the PowerPoint is here too. Just download the entire project as a zip.
